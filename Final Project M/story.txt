Over the past month our team got to work to create a specialized search engine system focused on three main topics: Technology, Astronomy, and Psychology. Our goal was to leverage the knowledge we gained throughout the course to build a robust, efficient, and user-friendly search engine tailored to these specific areas of interest.

The foundation of our search engine was built upon a custom web scraper that could efficiently crawl websites and extract relevant content. By utilizing a combination of libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, and jusText, we were able to effectively crawl and parse web pages, filter out unwanted content, and remove any unnecessary noise. This allowed us to focus on the most important aspects of the content and create a clean, organized dataset for future processing.

Once the content was collected, we implemented an inverted index for efficient content indexing and retrieval. This involved tokenizing the content, removing stopwords, and applying term frequency calculations. We also used the Soundex algorithm for fuzzy search functionality, to allow users to obtain relevant results even when their queries contained misspellings. In addition, we also incorporated machine learning techniques for document classification and query processing, which helped improve the overall search experience. Finally, we designed a ranking system which allowed us to display the most relevant search results to users based on their input query. Throughout the development process, we continually optimized our code and applied best practices to ensure a seamless and efficient search experience for end-users.
